# FrisbeeGolf
This is a program that I wrote for the final project of my intro Computer Science class. It is a frisbee golf game with 3 difficulty levels, and a pretty unintelligent computer player.  did not know how to create a computer player that could read its environment, so I created a computer player that essentially would throw the frisbee towards the bottom of the course until it was below all obstacles and then attempt to reach the goal with some randomness with the power that the computer power threw.
